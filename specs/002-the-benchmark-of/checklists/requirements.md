## Notes

**Validation completed successfully on 2025-10-12**

Scope: Convert and validate 6 specific benchmark forms (QF-GMD-06, -14, -01, -17, -19, -22) from Power Grid Company of Bangladesh. This is a validation/benchmark feature, not new system functionality.

Key characteristics:
- No new widget types needed (uses existing HTMLDSL capabilities)
- Focus is on conversion accuracy and visual fidelity
- 42 functional requirements covering all aspects of 6 forms
- 20 measurable success criteria
- 6 user stories (one per benchmark aspect: conversion, visual, print, functional, schema, end-to-end)

**Status**: READY FOR PLANNING - All validation criteria passed. Proceed with `/speckit.plan`

This feature validates the HTMLDSL system's production readiness by successfully converting 6 real-world enterprise forms.
