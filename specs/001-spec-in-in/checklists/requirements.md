## Notes

**Validation completed successfully on 2025-10-11**

Clarifications resolved:
- Q1: Sanitization strategy - Strict allowlist approach with no inline scripts (FR-075)
- Q2: Versioning strategy - Automatic migration with transformation rules (FR-080)
- Q3: Concurrent users - Support up to 50 concurrent users (SC-020)

Minor adjustments made to remove implementation-specific references:
- FR-046: Abstracted database-specific type mappings to generic relational database types
- Assumptions: Removed specific browser names and database versions, using generic descriptors

**Status**: READY FOR PLANNING - All validation criteria passed. Proceed with `/speckit.plan`
